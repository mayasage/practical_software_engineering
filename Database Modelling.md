## Design Methods

There are only two ways to design:

- (Top-down / Forward Engineering) to make a new project.
- (Bottom-up / Reverse Engineering) to understand old projects.

Top-down flow:

1. CDM (Conceptual Data Model)
2. LDM (Logical Data Model)
3. PDM (Physical Data Model)
4. Mongodb

## CDM (Conceptual Data Model)

### Five Questions of CDM

1. Answer in 3 sentences what your application will do.
2. Write if you must understand existing system.
3. Write if you need analytics.
4. Balance Flexibility with Simplicity (**Person** is more flexible than **Employee**).
5. Make diagrams that your audience can validate.

### Relational or Dimensional?

- Dimensional is for data warehouses.
  - It's for drilling down on numbers.
  - **Gross Sales Amount** per day

- Relational is what most developers do.
  - **Gross Sales Amount** per month

I only care about Relational.

### Identify & Define Concepts

#### Identify & Define Concepts: For Relational

This is a "Concept Template."

- Who's important to business? (Employee, Patient, Player, Suspect)
- What keeps business running? (Product or Service of business.)
- When is the business in operation? (Time, Month, Date)
- Where is business conducted? (Mail Address, IP Address)
- Why is business in business? (Business Events: Order, Return, Complaint)
- How does the business keep track of Events? (Invoice, Purchase Order, Sale Order)

You need to define Entities for all these questions.

#### Identify & Define Concepts: For Dimensional

Define business questions.

Example:

Show me the number of students receiving financial aid by department and semester for the last five years. (From Financial Aid Office).

Concepts:

- Student
- Department
- Semester
- Year
- Financial Indicator

### Capture Relationships

#### Capture Relationships: For Relational

NO granular data here ‚ùå.  
Ex: A/C Open Date, A/C Balance.  
It's not conceptual; it's logical (LDM).

Answer these **eight** Questions to determine relationships between two
entities:

- 4 Crow's notation questions:
  - 2 for participation:
    - 1 Entity A related to many Entity B?
    - 1 Entity B related to many Entity A?
  - 2 for optionality:
    - Entity A exists without Entity B?
    - Entity B exists without Entity A?
- 2 each for "should you show subtypes":
  - Any example you want to show? (**Person** can be **Teacher** or **Student**)
  - Does Entity go through a lifecycle? (**Processed Order** -> **Shipped Order**)

#### Capture Relationships: For Dimensional

Create a "grain matrix" from business questions.

It's a spreadsheet where:

- Columns:
  - are Dimensions (what do you need to find)
    - Each Dimension should be defined by a DB Query.
- Rows:
  - is Granularity (how deep you need to drill down to find the answer).

Example:

Business question:  
Show me the number of students receiving financial aid by department and semester for the last five years. (From Financial Aid Office)

Column: Student Count

Rows:

- Department
- Semester
- Year
- Financial Aid Indicator

Grain matrix:

|                         | Student Count |
|:-----------------------:|:-------------:|
|       Department        |    1, 2, 3    |
|        Semester         |    1, 2, 3    |
|          Year           |  1, 2, 3, 4   |
| Financial Aid Indicator |       1       |

## Atomic Concepts

### Column Naming

Pre-define "classwords," and append your column names with them.  
Always write full column names: id ‚ùå company_id ‚úî

| S.No. | Class Word |              Covers              |
|:-----:|:----------:|:--------------------------------:|
|   1   |    Name    |               Noun               |
|   2   |    Text    |              String              |
|   3   |   Amount   |          Monetary Value          |
|   4   |    Date    |              (¬¨_¬¨ )              |
|   5   |    Code    |  Short form of some information  |
|   6   |  Quantity  |       Non-monetary amount        |
|   7   |   Number   | NOT math number ‚ùå It's Phone No. |
|   8   | Identifier |              (¬¨_¬¨ )              |
|   9   | Indicator  |             Boolean              |
|  10   |    Rate    |              Ratio               |
|  11   |  Percent   |              (¬¨_¬¨ )              |
|  12   |  Complex   |     NOTA. It's PDF, MP4, MP3     |

Examples:

1. Country Code
2. Gross Sales ‚ùå Gross Sales Amount ‚úî
3. Free Checks Per Month (Quantity)
4. Credit Rating (Rate)

Pointers:

1. Divide EVERY column into one of these categories.

### Normalization

#### First Normal Form (1NF)

An Employee can't have more than One Phone Number ‚ùå

|     Before     |           After           |
|:--------------:|:-------------------------:|
| Phone Number 1 |   Employee Phone Number   |
| Phone Number 2 |  Department Phone Number  |
| Phone Number 3 | Organization Phone Number |
|       ‚ùå        |             ‚úî             |

#### Second Normal Form (2NF)

Break tables on the basis of relationships.

| employee_id | employee_name | job_code | job_name |
|:-----------:|---------------|:--------:|:--------:|
|      1      | Alice         |    1     | Waitress |
|      1      | Alice         |    2     |   Chef   |

Employee has a many-to-many relationship with Job.  
So break it down to three tables.

*employees:*

| employee_id | employee_name |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|
|      1      |     Alice     |

*jobs:*

| job_id | job_name |
|:------:|:--------:|
|   1    | Waitress |
|   2    |   Chef   |

*employee_jobs:*

| employee_id | job_id |
|:-----------:|:------:|
|      1      |   1    |
|      1      |   2    |

#### Third Normal Form (3NF)

Remove all derived attributes, duplicity, and transitive dependencies.

| employee_id | employee_name | supervisor_id | supervisor_name |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|      1      |     Alice     |       1       |      Malik      |

‚ùå NOT in 3NF.  
Because "supervisor_name" is transitively dependent on "employee_id."

Break the table down based on relationship.  
Employee has one-to-one relationship with Supervisor.

*employees:*

| employee_id | employee_name | supervisor_id |
|:-----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|      1      |     Alice     |       1       |

*supervisors:*

| supervisor_id | supervisor_name |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|
|       1       |      Malik      |

- Remember that DB doesn't understand relationships.
  It only understands Foreign Keys.
- ORMs use relationships to query & organize data.

#### Abstraction

I refuse to use this üò†.  
I hate this idea.  
DB should be absolutely clear without any IFs & BUTs.

Employee becomes a Party.  
Each Party has a Role, which can be an Employee or a Tennis Player.

Problems:

- Unclear, vague, & irritating:
  - Go into the code and understand IFs & BUTs.
  - Example: ONLY Role Employee must contain "start_date."

Benefits:

- Flexibility: (Counter) Mongodb doesn't even require this, as it's inherently
  flexible.
